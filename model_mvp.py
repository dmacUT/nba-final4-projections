1. Grab mean of all features (BTGM) for all teams

2. Calculate ORTG and DRTG based on a few features

3. Caculate a NetRTG (O-D)

4. Add target to BTGM based on name/yr (to get aligned to teams)

5. drop target and make it y variable

6. Predict y based off of NetRTG

7. OR make X all variables that will add up to ORTG and DRTG
